✅ **Now your GitHub repo is ready with:**
- Professional **README.md** with badges & logo  
- Fully functional **website** (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)  
- Folder for **logo and assets**  
- GitHub Pages ready

If you want, I can **also create a live demo version with animations, hover effects, and a navigation bar that scrolls smoothly**, so it looks like a **modern portfolio website**.  

Do you want me to do that next?
